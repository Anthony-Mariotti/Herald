# Herald the Discord Bot

Herald's primary purpose is to play music and play music well and reliable. 
Adding herald to your discord server will be available once the bot is fully 
developed. Herald is also "designed" to be a discord bot with the CQS pattern 
for multiple places of entry points where users can interact with the bot.

The bot is still a work in progress and probably will be slow to develop as I
have a full-time job and stream on twitch ([twitch.tv/amtraxtge](https://twitch.tv/amtraxtge)).
I'll be trying to get as many changes as I can, when I can.

## What does fully developed mean?

Classifying something as "Fully Developed" would mean no bugs / additional 
features or issues that would need to be resolved. Herald will have its first 
release once everything for the base bot is built and runs with a highly 
reliable nature.
