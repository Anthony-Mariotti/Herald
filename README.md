# Herald the Discord Bot

Heralds main purpose is to play music and play music well and reliable. Adding
herald to your discord server will be available once the bot is fully developed.

The bot is still a work in progress and probably will be slow to develop as I
have a full-time job and also stream on twitch
([twitch.tv/amtraxtge](https://twitch.tv/amtraxtge)). I'll be trying to get as
changes as I can, when I can.

## What does fully developed mean?

Classifying something as "Fully Developed" would mean that there is no bugs / 
additional features or issues that would need to be resolved. Herald will have
it's first release once everything for the base bot is built and it runs
with the up most reliability.
